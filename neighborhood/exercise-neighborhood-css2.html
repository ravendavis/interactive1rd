      <h2>The Top of Goat Rock</h2>
        <p>The remote coastline of Sonoma county provides many great places to visit but my favorite place would be the top of Goat Rock during sunrise or sunset. Its a fairly steep hike up the hill but its a pretty short track overall.

      <h2>Duncan's Landing</h2>
        <p> Duncans landing is known as the most dangerous beach in sonoma county due to its unpredictable surf but the view is simply killer.

      <h2>Foothill Regional Park</h2>
        <p>Foothills Regional Park is a perfect place to connect with nature and relax. Nearly all the 10 or so trails at Foothill are short and easy. Foothill preserves a classic gently rolling north bay landscape, but Foothill is augmented with 3 man-made ponds (created in the 60's, long before the land became a park). Although you can't swim here, the park district does permit fishing.
