      <h2>The Top of Goat Rock</h2>
        <p>The remote coastline of Sonoma county provides many great places to visit but my favorite place would be the top of Goat Rock during sunrise or sunset. Its a fairly steep hike up the hill but its a pretty short track overall.

      <h2>Duncan's Landing</h2>
        <p> Duncans landing is known as the most dangerous beach in sonoma county due to its unpredictable surf but the view is simply killer.

      <h2>Foothill Regional Park</h2>
        <p>Foothills Regional Park is a perfect place to connect with nature and relax. Nearly all the 10 or so trails at Foothill are short and easy. Foothill preserves a classic gently rolling north bay landscape, but Foothill is augmented with 3 man-made ponds (created in the 60's, long before the land became a park). Although you can't swim here, the park district does permit fishing.

      <h2>The Town Green</h2>
        <p> Also referred to as downtown Windsor, The town green is always filled with residents and tourists enjoying the restaurants and park provided. During the summer Windsor will host concerts and movie nights every Tuesday and Thursday night at the green.
