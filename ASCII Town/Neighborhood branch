        <p>The Sunset District holds a very special place in my heart, as not only is it one of the few places in San Francisco that's not filled to the brim with tech workers,
          but it still has a sense of identity and quirkiness that has not been able to be replicated by other suburbs in California.  <br><br>My family lived in the Sunset District
        for quite some time before I started attending public school in Sacramento.  Despite not having lived here for over a decade, this place still feels like home to me.</p>

      <h2>The Sunset Branch</h2>
        <p>The Sunset Branch of the San Francisco Public Library is an excellent place to sit down, relax, and enjoy some books and magazines.

      <h2>Cafe La Flore</h2>
        <p>La Flore is one of my favorite cafes to study at, and their vanilla mochas are absolutely exemplary.

      <h2>Ocean Beach</h2>
        <p>Ocean Beach may be incredibly cold, but it's always nice to take off your shoes and feel the sand between your toes.
